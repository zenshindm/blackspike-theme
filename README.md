# blackspike landing page

A free Seizo landing theme made with Tailwind to help kick start your Seizo website.

We built this page as the first version of our own website, blackspike.com, but switched to a different design later.

Rather than let it gather dust, we decided to modernise it, try out some fresh new CSS features and give it back to the Astro community.

You can read more about how we built it and the cool new tech we used on our blog post.
